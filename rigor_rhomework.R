#Go to https://classroom.github.com/a/cYkF9a_M to accept the homework, then:
  
#1) Create an R Project to pull “CompRepro.rmd” file from GitHub.

#2) In the file, please describe one of the ways that Wilson et. al. suggest is 
  #a good practice for computational reproducibility and how a tool like R can be used. 
  #Write your answer below.

#One good practice is tracking changes and recording how your projects evolve over time.
#R is useful because it allows you to do this with commenting.
#R is overall useful for faster statstical analysis and keeping your data in one place that can be easily looked up later.


#3) Add a code chunk and find the square root of 4 to the 13th power. If you are unsure of what 
  #command to use, google it. 

(sqrt(4))^13

#4) Save the file, commit the changes, and push the homework to the GitHub repository for the homework.
